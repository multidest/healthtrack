things to do


#add list of medications to patient.
#add list of appointments to patient.

change permissions to not delete anything

#add lab orders to encounter
#add pharmacy orders to encounter
#add recomended_followup to encounter


Notes of things I would do differently.

More exactly qualify what some of the fields should be. For example, what is followup?

python manage.py dumpdata > dbtest
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/inc1.json
